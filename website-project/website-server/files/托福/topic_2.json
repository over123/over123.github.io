          "A university education should encourage students to engage with the world around them, but I see less and less of that engagement on campus today. I propose, therefore, that the university make community service, such as working with the local children in town, a mandatory activity for all university students before they graduate. Creating a community service requirement is a good idea because it would strengthen the relationship between our school and the town. Additionally, in fulfilling the requirement, many students would discover a love of service that would inspire them to a lifetime of volunteer work in their future communities.",

          "Woman: So you don't agree with it？",
          "Man: Nope. If anything, it's going to hurt our relationship with our town.",
          "I mean forcing students to volunteer,",
          "it's gonna make them see it as a chore, a nuisance,",
          "and so they're not gonna to put their hearts into it,",
          "which is gonna make the university look bad.",
          "Woman: You are saying that students doing volunteer work in town will be unenthusiastic and...",
          "Man: Right. It'll be obvious they don't want to be there.",
          "That's sure not going to make things better,",
          "you know, in terms of how were regarded by people in the local community.",
          "Woman: But maybe students would learn to like it.",
          "Man: I really doubt it. The whole idea that this is gonna to encourage students to do more volunteering in the future is just ridiculous.",
          "A lot of students are likely to come away from the experience with negative feelings about it.",
          "Woman: Yeah, especially if their studies suffer from being forced to spend time away from them.",
          "Man: All the students I know already complain about not having enough time as it is.",
          "So this extra work is going to be a bad experience,",
          "hardly inspiration for them to pursue more volunteer work after they graduate.",
          "Question",
          "The man expresses his opinion of the student's proposal in the letter. State the man's opinion and explain the reasons he gives for holding that opinion."

          "Systems Thinking",
          "Companies have designed new and improved ways to solve problems within their organizations. Rather than seeking a simple cause and a direct solution to problems, companies are now using an approach called systems thinking. Systems thinking involves solving problems long-term by considering the \"big picture,\" that is, how the interaction of many different parts of a large system may contribute to a problem. Companies use systems thinking because, even though it may produce complex solutions that take a long time to implement, it is an effective way to solve problems and has a greater long-term benefit to the company.",

          "who began by interviewing a lot of the workers and getting to know more about them.",

          "such as poor eating habits and lack of exercise.",

          "that this indirectly contributed to the workers' poor health.",
          "The consultant proposed building a gym within the company office building for employees to use to exercise,",

          "Actually they did.",
          "They continued to have regular patterns of sleeping and waking.",

          "Instead of following 24-hour cycles,",
          "the squirrels followed cycles that were about half an hour shorter than that.",
